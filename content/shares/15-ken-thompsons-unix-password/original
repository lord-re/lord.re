    Ken Thompson&#39;s Unix password
  </a>  
</h2>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Somewhere around 2014 I found an <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-3-Snapshot-Development/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> file in some dumps
of the BSD 3 source tree, containing passwords of all the old timers
such as Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Brian W. Kernighan, Steve Bourne
and Bill Joy.</p>

<p>Since the DES-based
<a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/man/man3/crypt.3">crypt(3)</a>
algorithm used for these hashes is well known to be weak (and limited
to at most 8 characters), I thought it would be an easy target to just
crack these passwords for fun.</p>

<p>Well known tools for this are <a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/">john</a>
and <a href="https://hashcat.net/wiki/">hashcat</a>.</p>

<p>Quickly, I had cracked a fair deal of these passwords,
many of which were very weak.
(Curiously, <code>bwk</code> used <code>/.,/.,</code>, which is easy to type on a QWERTY keyboard.)</p>

<p>However, <code>ken</code>s password eluded my cracking endeavor.  Even an exhaustive search
over all lower-case letters and digits took several days (back in 2014)
and yielded no result.  Since the algorithm was developed by
Ken Thompson and Robert Morris, I wondered what&#8217;s up there.
I also realized, that, compared to other password hashing schemes
(such as NTLM), crypt(3) turns out to be quite a bit slower to crack
(and perhaps was also less optimized).</p>

<p>Did he really use uppercase letters or even special chars?
(A 7-bit exhaustive search would still take over 2 years on a modern GPU.)</p>

<p>The topic <a href="https://inbox.vuxu.org/tuhs/tqkjt9nn7p9zgkk9cm9d@localhost/T/#m160f0016894ea471ae02ee9de9a872f2c5f8ee93">came up
again</a>
earlier this month on <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/">The Unix Heritage Society</a>
mailing list, and I <a href="https://inbox.vuxu.org/tuhs/87bluxpqy0.fsf@vuxu.org/">shared my
results</a> and
frustration of not being able to break <code>ken</code>s password.</p>

<p>Finally, today this secret <a href="https://inbox.vuxu.org/tuhs/CACCFpdx_6oeyNkgH_5jgfxbxWbZ6VtOXQNKOsonHPF2=747ZOw@mail.gmail.com/">was resolved</a> by Nigel Williams:</p>

Subject: Re: [TUHS] Recovered /etc/passwd files

ken is done:

ZghOT0eRm4U9s:p/q2-q4!

took 4+ days on an AMD Radeon Vega64 running hashcat at about 930MH/s
during that time (those familiar know the hash-rate fluctuates and
slows down towards the end).

<p>This is a chess move in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_notation">descriptive
notation</a>, and
the beginning of <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._d4">many common openings</a>.
It fits very well
to Ken Thompson&#8217;s <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/index.php?title=Ken_Thompson">background in computer
chess</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very happy that this mystery has been solved now
and I&#8217;m pleased of the answer.</p>
